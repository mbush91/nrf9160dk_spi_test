# Sample for SPI communication on the nRF9160dk

Not currently working. Not sure why

Much of this is based on https://github.com/too1/ncs-spi-master-slave-example

## Setup

Two applications exist one for the nRF91 chip and one for the nRF52 chip

The nRF91 is setup at the slave so we can attach additional chips on the SPI bus to the nRF52 chip
